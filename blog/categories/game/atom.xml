    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About two months ago,I bought a handheld game device.That's PS Vita the Sony's new generation game machine.Performance getsa bigboost relative to last generation of handheld game device PSP,which include largerresolutions(4xboost),double joysticks,front-facing and back-facing camera and rear-touch.The whole machine sense better than feelssosoplastic on the PSP.I don't want play PSP after bought PSV.I like it.</p>

<p>But game is less relative to PSP,and no cracked.Therefore the more money game player pay for buy games.For this matter,most ordinary player unacceptable in China.But PSV will become better and better on future.Game also will become more and more.No cracked might not be a bad thing.Game more and more premise is player can pay for game.</p>

<p>So far,I bought four games:Ninja Gaiden Sigma,Person 4 The Gold,Gravity Rush and DJMAX Technika Tune.I often exchange game with others firend.So I can save so much money.Altogether I played ten games.</p>
